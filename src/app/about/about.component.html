  Hey!</p>
  <p>A few thing about Yours Truly:</p>
    <p>I am Samidha.</p>
      <p>I am book <b>blogger</b> and <b>reviewer</b>, literature and womenâ€™s studies student, creative writer, positivity spreader, traveler, chai-enthusiast, fiction hoader, and meme sharer. I have had this blog for almost four years now, and actively work towards bringing new and short reviews for folks who, like me, prefer fiction to reality. I try to focus on bringing under/ unappreciated books to light. I am still working towards that goal.</p>

        <p>Well I hope that the idea behind this blog resonates with you, somehow â€“ sometime. I review books on Goodreads as well. I am passionate about good writing, good genres, and <b>good Chai</b>. I am mostly eating, sleeping, exploring, or writing pen pal letters whenever I am not curled up with a book. Or <b>BINGE WATCHING EVERY SHOW EVER.</b></p>

          <p>I try to be as creative as possible with the blog, and do <b>picture-stories</b> and <b>poetry</b>, sometimes.</p>

            <p>Well apart from this I am pretty much an underdog, sorting her way through life. Feedback and comments are always welcome, for anything.</p>

              <p>Thank you for being a part of my book community. I truly appreciate it ðŸ™‚</p>
